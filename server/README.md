## Database Design

The database schema is designed using a relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) and consists of the following tables:

- `users`: Stores user information such as ID, name, email, and hashed passwords.
  - Columns: id, name, email, password
- `events`: Stores event information including event ID, name, date, time, venue, available tickets, and ticket prices.
  - Columns: id, name, date, time, venue, available_tickets, ticket_price
- `tickets`: Stores information about individual tickets associated with an event.
  - Columns: id, event_id, ticket_number, is_booked
- `bookings`: Stores booking details such as booking ID, user ID, event ID, number of tickets, and booking status.
  - Columns: id, user_id, event_id, ticket_id, booking_status

The relationships between the tables are as follows:
- One user can have multiple bookings (one-to-many relationship between `users` and `bookings`).
- One event can have multiple tickets (one-to-many relationship between `events` and `tickets`).
- One booking can have multiple tickets (one-to-many relationship between `bookings` and `tickets`).

## User Management

The user management system includes the following functionality:

- User registration: Users can create an account by providing their name, email, and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in using their email and password.
- User profile update: Users can update their profile information, including name and password.

## Event Management

The event management APIs provide the following functionality:

- Add event: Administrators can add new events to the system by providing event details such as name, date, time, venue, available tickets, and ticket prices.
- Update event: Administrators can update event information such as available tickets and ticket prices.
- Delete event: Administrators can delete events from the system.

## Ticket Booking

The ticket booking functionality includes the following features:

- Search events: Users can search for events based on criteria such as event name, date, venue, etc.
- Select event: Users can select an event and specify the number of tickets they want to book.
- Book tickets: The system handles concurrent booking requests and reduces the number of available tickets. It creates a booking entry in the database with a unique booking ID or ticket number.

## Ticket Cancellation

The ticket cancellation functionality allows users to cancel their bookings. It includes the following features:

- Cancel booking: Users can cancel their bookings, which increases the number of available tickets for the event. The booking entry is removed from the database.

## Booking History

The booking history functionality enables users to view their booking history, including details of the events they have booked, the number of tickets, and the booking status.

## Security and Validation

To ensure data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities, the following measures are implemented:

- User password hashing: User passwords are securely hashed using a strong hashing algorithm before storing in the database.
- Input validation: Proper input validation is implemented to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Error handling

: Error handling is implemented to provide informative error messages for various scenarios.

## Testing

Unit tests are written to validate the functionality of each API endpoint. Thorough testing is performed to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

## Deployment and Documentation

The backend application can be deployed on a hosting platform or server of your choice. The API endpoints and their functionalities are documented, including request/response formats and any required authentication. Detailed instructions are provided on how to set up and run the application.


## API Documentation

The API documentation provides detailed information about each API endpoint, including request/response formats and any required authentication. You can access the API documentation by visiting `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the backend server is running.
